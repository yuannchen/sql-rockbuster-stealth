Here are some important highlights of important queries in the project:

1. Top 10 countries in terms of customer numbers

  SELECT D.country, COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count
  FROM customer A
  INNER JOIN address B on A. address_id = B.address_id
  INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
  INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
  GROUP BY D.country
  ORDER BY customer_count
  LIMIT 10;

2. Top 10 cities that fall within the top 10 countries

  SELECT D.country, C.city, COUNT(A.customer_id)
  FROM customer A
  INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
  INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
  INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
  WHERE D.country_id IN (
  	SELECT D.country_id 
  	FROM customer A
  	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
  	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
  	INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
  	GROUP BY D.country_id
  	ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
  	LIMIT 10
  	)
  GROUP BY D.country, C.city
  ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
  LIMIT 10;

3. Top 5 customers from the top 10 cities whoâ€™ve paid the highest total amounts to Rockbuster

  SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city, SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
  FROM payment A
  INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
  INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
  INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
  WHERE D.city in (
  	SELECT D.city
  	FROM customer B
  	INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
  	INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  	INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
  	WHERE E.country IN (
  		SELECT E.country
  		FROM customer B
  		INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
  		INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  		INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
  		GROUP BY E.country
  		ORDER BY COUNT(B.customer_id) DESC 
  		LIMIT 10
  	)
  	GROUP BY E.country, D.city
  	ORDER BY COUNT(B.customer_id) DESC
  	LIMIT 10
  	)
  GROUP BY B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city
  ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
  LIMIT 5;
